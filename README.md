# Etch-a-Sketch

This is my Etch-a-Sketch project for The Odin Project. It was created using Javascript, CSS, and HTML. 

The etch-a-sketch allows you to choose between three modes: regular, rainbow (i.e. multicolored), and shades (i.e. white. grey, and black). 

You can also reset the grid to any size that you would like. 

Enjoy!
